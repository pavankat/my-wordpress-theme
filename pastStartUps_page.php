		<h2>Company Number One: MyFitSolution.com</h2>
		
		<p class="lead">
		<strong>life span:</strong> October 2008 - July 2011
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What it Was: </strong>MyFitSolution aimed to provide one-on-one workout sessions and diet advice that personal training offers but at 90% lower than the average cost of personal training. You can see a demo of MyFitSolution.com <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwncSa5GVNA">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did right: </strong>raised capital, did surveying to see if people wanted the service, made a product back log, made wire frames, attained press for the Company, attained a high Google Page Rank of 4.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did wrong:</strong> I wrote a business plan, made too many features in the product back log (didn't go lean), outsourced the bulk of the design and development of the site (what a mess), I chose Co-Founders that knew less web development than I did (I only knew HTML), never got users onto the site, because we spent all our time building features.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I learned: </strong>I learned to skip the business plan (waste of time), minimize features to the core essentials, hire a US developer over a foreign developer, and be really picky about who I bring on to my team.

		<h2>Company Number Two: RockstarVisible.com</h2>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>life span:</strong><strong> </strong>April 2010 to September 2010
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What it Was:</strong> A SEO Firm.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did right:</strong> Skipped the business plan, Signed on clients, built the website with minimum help, beat out over 32 million web pages, and got a page one ranking on Google for the keyword phrase: "getting ranked", sold the website to Splib Media LLC on Flippa.com.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did wrong: </strong>Didn't sign contracts with clients, didn't charge enough, didn't focus on a niche of clients, expanded too fast with paid sales interns.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I learned:</strong> Sign contracts with your clients, charge clients a fair amount for them and you, focus on a niche of clients, don't expand until you're monetarily comfortable.

		<h2>Company Number Three: BloggersCompete.com</h2>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>life span:</strong> April 2010 to October 2011
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What it Was:</strong> It helped advertisers get more customers by getting higher search engine rankings by launching blog contests on the site. A blog contest gets lots of bloggers to blog about something and link to the advertiser's site. Bloggers got paid if they won the contests and got other free stuff from the advertiser for participating.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did right: </strong>I got the site a lot of press. It was featured on <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/both-bloggers-and-advertisers-win-with-new-crowd-sourcing-platform-2011-09">Web Pro News</a>, <a href="http://www.blogworld.com/2011/08/29/bloggerscompete-com-bloggers-compete-advertisers-win/">Blog World</a>, <a href="http://www.blogengage.com/blogger/bloggers-compete-compete-with-other-bloggers/">Blog Engage</a> and <a href="http://weblogbetter.com/2011/08/01/promote-blog-contest/">We Blog Better</a>. I was able to launch the site much quicker than my first failure (3 times faster), but it still took over a year to launch the site. After all the SEO and press generation I did for the site it constantly gets organic traffic even though it's not active at all. It has over 350+ users on the site. The site also got paid customers. I sold the website on Flippa.com to Noizu Inc in Washington.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I did wrong:</strong> I hired a US freelancer instead of doing all the development myself. The freelancer I hired was late a lot of times and would code without testing the code. I was the one left testing and writing up bug reports. We didn't use version control, so we wrote over each other's work sometimes. I cut the features down significantly to the bare essentials, but we could've coded out things so that it could've been per client basis and launched in a month or so. I also hired a designer that made a lot of mistakes too. I had to write up docs with screen shots explaining what was wrong a lot. All in all, I spent a lot of money (close to 10 grand) and the site got customers, press, users, but in the end the idea didn't work out.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		<strong>What I learned: </strong>Clients' campaigns weren't working always for them. If we manually coded out things per client, then I could have cut down development time by 80% and found out that the site had to pivot much sooner than later.
		</p>

		<p class="lead">
		Just because you can kind of afford to build out your idea, doesn't mean you should pay for it, because chances are you're going to have to pivot your Company into a different direction, and when you've used up a lot of your money, you're not going to be willing to put more to it. It's best to do it yourself first even though it's not going to be amazing, and when you know your idea works - that's when you spend money. It sounds like a no brainer, and I wish it was back when I started this venture.
