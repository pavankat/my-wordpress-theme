		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p class="lead">I’m 25 and I’ve done a bunch of things. I live with my perfect girl friend, 2 cats and rabbit in Summit, New Jersey.</p> 

		<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>

		<p class="lead">I’ve <a href="what-i-learned-from-past-start-ups/">learned a lot from my ventures</a>. The most important things I learned are coding and building lean products that de-risk assumptions.</p> 

		<p class="lead">After acquiring those valuable skills, I Co-Founded <a href="http://www.inrtracker.com" target="_blank">INRtracker.com</a>. INR Tracker is the definitive solution for individuals taking blood thinners. You can learn a bit more about INR Tracker in the <a href="/index.php#work">My Work</a> section of this website.</p>

		<h2>Coding</h2>

		<p class="lead">I've been rapidly getting better at coding. I started making websites when I was 12, but I never did anything database driven. It wasn't until I was 23 that I really pushed myself and seriously learned to code. I guess it sometimes takes 11 years for someone to rediscover their passion. At first, learning to code was something I did to cut the costs and time it takes to launch a web venture. However, throughout that process of learning to code, I fell in love with it all. I fell in love with how writing a few lines could make dynamic things happen on the screen. I loved how something could be expressed in multiple ways. How thousands of people could be using what I made and that all the data could be seen visually organized in a database. Coding makes me feel like the owner of my own universe that I invisioned and determined.</p> 

		<h2>Comedian</h2>

		<p class="lead">In highschool, college and a bit after college I did <a href="http://youtu.be/w-h86S0HrU0" target="_blank">stand up comedy</a> at clubs and Coffee Shops. I loved making crowds laugh and helping them escape their lives for a little bit.</p> 

		<h2>College</h2>

		<p class="lead">I got my degree in Math and Econ from Rutgers University in 2009. The one relative class that I took to coding was Intro to Computer Science for Math majors, which was pretty much the same as the normal Intro to Computer Science, but we used the programming language MATLAB, instead of JAVA. </p>

		<p class="lead">I took a lot of hard classes in college: Intro to Biomedical Engineering, Theoretical Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Linear Optimization and the laundry list could go on. However, <span class="underline">none of them nearly impacted me as much as my Buddhism and Acting classes</span>. I had the most brilliant Professor and Teacher. Their classes changed the way I thought about perceiving the world, what was possible and made all the money that was spent on college totally freaking worth it. <br> <a href="#" id="collegeMore">See more >></a> <a href="#" id="collegeLess" class="lead"><< See less</a></p>

				I took Buddhism in college thinking it would be more of a history class. I couldn't of been more wrong. This class was a mix of philosophy, science, sociology, religion and history all put together. This class forever changed the way I think about the world, think about myself, think inside my head and react to things. I learned that ignorance is the greatest evil on Earth. And it makes sense. Think of anything evil and ignorance will be at fault. 
				<br><br>
				For example, if a Doctor is ignorant and thinks that all-natural ways do not work, then the mind of that Doctor is completely closed off to possible solutions derived from all-natural ways. This Doctor could be helping more people and could become more of an effective Doctor, by being more open and reducing ignorance. 
				<br><br>
				That very basic piece of wisdom has changed everything for me, because I became AWARE of my ignorance. Whenever, I catch myself being ignorant, I find myself realizing it and I correct it by opening my mind.
				<br><br>
				Something else I learned was about attachment and permanence. Nothing we know of in this Universe is permanent. Nothing. Yet, everyone is attached to things as if they are permanent. By just understanding, and constantly being aware that things we are attached to are impermanent, we can effectively reduce our suffering. For example, I know that one day my pets won't be with me. I love them a lot and by understanding that they will be gone one day, I cherish every moment with them more. I make sure to have no regrets. It's a tiny bit like Carpe diem, but Buddhism's way makes a lot more sense and is easier to adopt, because thinking every day is your last is fucking stupid.

				I took Basic Acting in college thinking it would be an easy way to fufill a graduation requirement, however due to me missing 2 classes and a strict attendance policy, I was on the verge of failing. I talked to the Teacher of the class, and he said that I most certainly would fail the class and that he might pass me, but for my Final Performance, I'd have to dig deep and do incredible. So, I worked really hard and tried to take in what it meant to be a really good actor. Much to my surprise, what I learned was that good acting is the OPPOSITE of FAKING emotions and reactions. Good acting is being able to react and elicit emotions TRUTHFULLY, and one can do that by doing tons of ANALYSIS! It was the most jaw dropping thing I learned in college, because I never thought of acting in that way before. 
				<br><br>
				It constantly makes me wonder what other things in life I'm misinterpreting. This has been my secret weapon in start ups. 
				<br><br>

				My entire major was dedicated to being good at analysis, so I knew I had a shot of being good at acting. For the Final Performance, I not only memorized my lines, but I made sure that I wrote reasons for every one of my lines and my partner's lines. I made sure to write thorough intricate background stories for my character that explained why he was saying what he was saying and why his partner was saying the things she was saying to him. By the end of this process, I had around 20 pages of background written, even though the play was just 2 pages long. When it came time for my Final Performance, I was able to read my lines as if the conversation was actually happening and react so honestly to what my partner was saying that I was the only one to get a standing round of applause. The Teacher passed me, and told everyone in the class that what I did was exactly what he wanted everyone to do.
